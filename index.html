This article is about style performance improvement with Shadow DOM, but it also contains a useful comparison of selector performance between ids, classes and data attributes:
ID and class selectors are fast enough that actually it doesn’t matter much whether shadow DOM is used or not – in fact, they’re slightly faster without shadow DOM. This indicates that systems like Svelte, CSS Modules, or good old-fashioned BEM are using the best approach performance-wise.
This also indicates that using attributes for style encapsulation does not scale well compared to classes. So perhaps scoping systems like Vue would be better off switching to classes.</span>

You know about accessibility, you know it’s important, and no one up the food chain (all them bosses) is challenging this (or invested enough to care). That’s great news! Let’s make that project A C C E S S I B L E. ✨
That’s pretty daunting though. It can be tricky to know how to even get started with such a big task. Fear not! In this piece, we’re going to see how to get started with accessibility so it’s considered all throughout the development lifecycle of the project instead of at the end like usual.
Learn what accessibility is
Write documentation
Have a checklist
Automate what you can
Centralize logic

Here&#x27;s a good introduction to the Fediverse from Paula, with details about Mastodon and Pixelfed.
Imagine Twitter, Facebook, Instagram &amp; Co were all part of one giant network. That&#x27;s basically what the fediverse is, except the parts are less well known, free &amp; decentralized alternatives to those.
E.g. Mastodon is like Twitter, Friendica is like Facebook, Pixelfed is like Instagram and there are many more.
If you e.g. have a Mastodon account you can follow accounts on Friendica or Pixelfed and you might not even notice, that they are not Mastodon accounts.
You can find me in these too:
