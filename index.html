                    <span>Next.js has strong opinions about how to organize JavaScript but not CSS. How can we develop patterns that encourage best CSS practices while also following the framework’s logic? The answer is surprisingly simple — to write well-structured CSS that balances global and local styling concerns.</span>

                    <span>Hashnode is a free platform for developer blogging. Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.

Shaping things up
Here are the things we want to achieve:
Making a distinction between fetching a single entry or a collection.
Avoiding constructing GROQ queries manually.
Giving precedence to draft content if instructed so via an option.
To solve our first point, we’re going to author 2 functions: getEntry and getEntries. The first one will always return a single entry, while the second one will always return an array of entries.
Our second point is going to be addressed by passing different arguments to our functions, all of which will be combined to construct a GROQ query which will eventually be forwarded to the Sanity c…</span>

Bramus shows how the situation might finally improve for viewport height CSS units, more than 6 years after I reported the unreliable 100vh value as a bug to webkit, and webkit replied it was &quot;intended&quot;.
Be careful with the upcoming dynamic viewport units (dvh/dvb, dvmin and dvmax at least), as using it to size things in the block axis, as it may generate unpleasant changes in the UI.</span>
