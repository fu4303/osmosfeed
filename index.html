You know about accessibility, you know it’s important, and no one up the food chain (all them bosses) is challenging this (or invested enough to care). That’s great news! Let’s make that project A C C E S S I B L E. ✨
That’s pretty daunting though. It can be tricky to know how to even get started with such a big task. Fear not! In this piece, we’re going to see how to get started with accessibility so it’s considered all throughout the development lifecycle of the project instead of at the end like usual.
Learn what accessibility is
Write documentation
Have a checklist
Automate what you can
Centralize logic

Imagine Twitter, Facebook, Instagram &amp; Co were all part of one giant network. That&#x27;s basically what the fediverse is, except the parts are less well known, free &amp; decentralized alternatives to those.
E.g. Mastodon is like Twitter, Friendica is like Facebook, Pixelfed is like Instagram and there are many more.
If you e.g. have a Mastodon account you can follow accounts on Friendica or Pixelfed and you might not even notice, that they are not Mastodon accounts.
You can find me in these too:

                    <span>Hashnode is a free platform for developer blogging. Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.
