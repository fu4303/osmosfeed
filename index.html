This article is about style performance improvement with Shadow DOM, but it also contains a useful comparison of selector performance between ids, classes and data attributes:
ID and class selectors are fast enough that actually it doesn’t matter much whether shadow DOM is used or not – in fact, they’re slightly faster without shadow DOM. This indicates that systems like Svelte, CSS Modules, or good old-fashioned BEM are using the best approach performance-wise.
This also indicates that using attributes for style encapsulation does not scale well compared to classes. So perhaps scoping systems like Vue would be better off switching to classes.</span>

                    <span>I recently moved a significant codebase from Create-React-App (CRA for short) to Next and thought I would share my experience, because believe me or not, it was quite a journey (and not necessarily a pleasant one).
There are plenty reasons why you might want to move to Next from a CRA app. It provides server-side rendering (SSR), and even incremental static regeneration (ISR) when hosted on Vercel. It’s an encompassing framework with built-in routing, image optimization, development environment, and more.
This post is a high-level walkthrough of things to deal with to finalized the migration from CRA to Next. Here’s what we’ll cover:
HTML boilerplate
Head content
Routing
Code splitting
Styling
CSR/SSR
Linting
Running both systems

Here&#x27;s a good introduction to the Fediverse from Paula, with details about Mastodon and Pixelfed.
Imagine Twitter, Facebook, Instagram &amp; Co were all part of one giant network. That&#x27;s basically what the fediverse is, except the parts are less well known, free &amp; decentralized alternatives to those.
E.g. Mastodon is like Twitter, Friendica is like Facebook, Pixelfed is like Instagram and there are many more.
If you e.g. have a Mastodon account you can follow accounts on Friendica or Pixelfed and you might not even notice, that they are not Mastodon accounts.
You can find me in these too:
