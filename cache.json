That's basically what the fediverse is, except the parts are less well known, free & decentralized alternatives to those.\nE.g. Mastodon is like Twitter, Friendica is like Facebook, Pixelfed is like Instagram and there are many more.\nIf you e.g. have a Mastodon account you can follow accounts on Friendica or Pixelfed and you might not even notice, that they are not Mastodon accounts.\nYou can find me in these too:\nMastodon\nPixelfed",
